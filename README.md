# restaurant-page

This project was created as part of The Odin Project Curriculum. The goal here is to create a dynamic restaurant homepage using [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org).

This project had the most directories, files, and other assets I've worked with so far. Managing the different files, figuring out where to put specific code, keeping track of different elements and changes was more challenging than in previous projects. In looking through the different directories/files I realized that some of the git commit messages were not relevant to the file. These were errors where I either committed more files than intended or lost track of the different changes. This was a good learning experience. In the future, it'll be helpful to commit changes more often and to be more mindful of the specific files committed to Git.
